# dc-scripts
My humble attempts at writing scripts for the UNIX dc (desktop calculator).
In each of them there is a description of the algorithm I used (in human-readable form), a list of the registers I needed, the macros I defined as well as the literal strings that are shown to the user.

To run these scripts, first run "dc --version" in a terminal of your choice. If the command was not found, install it.ยน  Then, run "dc $FILE", changing $FILE with the script you want to run, or give that script execution rights and execute it as an ordinary program.

ยน I used the version "dc (GNU bc 1.06.95) 1.3.95", though the only GNU extension I used is comments. If your version does not support comments starting with #, remove from these scripts everything from # to the end of the line.
